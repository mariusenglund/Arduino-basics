# Arduino basics
This repo contains projects using some of the most basic principles in the Arduino world. Probably useless to most, but maybe useful to some.


## Projects
* [Basic LED control](/basic-led-control/README.md/#basic-led-control) is a simple program to dim, blink and fade an LED with millis() using a button and a potensiometer.
